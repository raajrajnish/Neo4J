# Cypher - [Query a Neo4j database](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/cypher-intro/)

Cypher is Neo4j’s graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph. It is like SQL for graphs, and was inspired by SQL so it lets you 
focus on what data you want out of the graph.

Cypher is unique because it provides a visual way of matching patterns and relationships.When you write a query, you draw a graph pattern through your data.
Neo4j users use Cypher to construct expressive and efficient queries to do any kind of create, read, update, or delete (CRUD) on their graph, and Cypher is 
the primary interface for Neo4j.


Cypher’s constructs, based on English prose and neat iconography, make queries easy both to write and to read.
