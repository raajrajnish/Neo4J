### Neo4j Graph Database

Neo4j Graph Database is the core product, a native graph database that is built to store and retrieve connected data.
Two editions, a Community Edition and an Enterprise Edition, are available.

### Neo4j Aura

Neo4j is a cloud-friendly database, with a variety of cloud deployment options available. You can run Neo4j on public clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Neo4j Aura is a fully managed, cloud-native graph service, that gives developers and data scientists advanced graph tech tools. Neo4j Aura includes AuraDB and AuraDS.

Neo4j AuraDB is a graph database as a service.

Neo4j AuraDS makes it easy to run graph algorithms on Neo4j by integrating two main components:
- Neo4j Database, where graph data are loaded and stored, and Cypher® queries and all database operations (for example user management, query termination, etc.) are executed.
- Graph Data Science, a software component installed in the Neo4j Database, which main purpose is to run graph algorithms on in-memory projections of Neo4j Database.

Neo4j AuraDS is available on GCP.

### Neo4j Graph Data Science

Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) gives you access to more than 65 graph algorithms, which can be executed with Neo4j and optimized for enterprise workloads and pipelines. GDS helps you to get insights from big data in order to answer critical questions and improve predictions.

### Neo4j Tools

- Neo4j Desktop — a local development environment for working with Neo4j, whether using local database instances or databases located on remote servers. Free download includes Neo4j Enterprise Edition license.
- Neo4j Browser — online browser interface to query and view the data in the database. Basic visualization capabilities using Cypher query language.
- Neo4j Operations Manager (NOM) — a UI-based tool that enables a database administrator to monitor, administer, and operate all of the Neo4j database management systems in an Enterprise Edition.
- Data Importer — a no-code tool that allows you to load data from flat files (.csv and .tsv), define a graph model, map your data to it, and import it to your Neo4j database.
- Neo4j Bloom — visualization tool for business users that does not require any code or programming skills to view and analyze data. See the Documentation for more information.

### Cypher query language

Cypher is an open data query language, based on the openCypher initiative. It is the most established and intuitive query language used for property graphs.

### Connecting to Neo4j

- Neo4j Drivers — Officially supported drivers and community-contributed libraries.
- Neo4j Connectors — A set of connectors to integrate your existing workflow with Neo4j.
- GraphQL Library is a flexible, low-code, open source JavaScript library that enables rapid API development for cross-platform and mobile applications by tapping into the power of connected data.
- OGM — An Object Graph Mapping Library for Neo4j.
